## Our topic is gonna be about Using embryonic STEM cells to treat various conditions or illnesses

## Research

[General info (science daily)](https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/embryonic_stem_cell.htm#:~:text=Embryonic%20stem%20cells%20(ESCs)%20are,%3A%20ectoderm%2C%20endoderm%20and%20mesoderm.).  
ES cells are pluripotent, that is, they are able to differentiate into all derivatives of the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm.

These include each of the more than 220 cell types in the adult body.

Pluripotency distinguishes embryonic stem cells from adult stem cells found in adults; while embryonic stem cells can generate all cell types in the body, adult stem cells are multipotent and can produce only a limited number of cell types.

Additionally, under defined conditions, embryonic stem cells are capable of propagating themselves indefinitely.

This allows embryonic stem cells to be employed as useful tools for both research and regenerative medicine, because they can produce limitless numbers of themselves for continued research or clinical use.

> After many months of growth in culture dishes, these remarkable cells maintain the ability to form cells ranging from muscle to nerve to bloodâ€”potentially any cell type that makes up the body. The proliferative and developmental potential of human ES cells promises an essentially unlimited supply of specific cell types for basic research and for transplantation therapies for diseases ranging from heart disease to Parkinson's disease to leukemia.
